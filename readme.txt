== Description ==

This plugin allows you to block spam, very easily, efficiently and quickly!

You can use a CAPTCHA code on your comment form to stop automated spam bots. Users must enter the correct code to submit a comment. Logged in users do not see the field!

Also, you can enable a basic maths question which all of your users should be able to answer. It just makes it slightly more difficult for spam bots.

Another option you have is to set your own custom question and custom answer - This makes it nearly impossible for a spam bot to bypass - Just make the question simple so your users can answer it!



It's very easy to setup the plugin - Simply enable it and alter the settings!
